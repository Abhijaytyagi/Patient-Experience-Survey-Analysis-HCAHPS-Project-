# 🏥 HCAHPS Patient Experience Survey Analysis

A data-driven analysis of U.S. patient satisfaction survey responses using the HCAHPS dataset. This project explores trends in healthcare quality, identifies perception gaps across regions and care measures, and delivers actionable insights through interactive visualizations and statistical segmentation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world **market research analyst workflow** — from survey analysis to insight generation — with a focus on the healthcare industry. It mirrors key responsibilities required by roles in **data analytics**, **market research**, and **healthcare consulting**.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze HCAHPS patient satisfaction survey data to identify care quality trends.
- Segment responses by **state**, **hospital performance**, and **care domains** (communication, responsiveness, discharge, etc.).
- Build **interactive dashboards** to visualize insights.
- Recommend data-informed strategies to improve healthcare delivery and patient perception.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Power BI** for dashboard development
- **Excel** for early data exploration
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analysis
- **Git** for version control

## 📊 Key Features

- Cleaned and joined multiple CSV datasets using `pandas` for robust data pipelines.
- Applied statistical summaries and visualization to explore **geographic and domain-level trends**.
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards to enable **self-service analytics** for stakeholders.
- Delivered insights in presentation-ready formats, replicating a **real client-facing analysis** scenario.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Patient satisfaction shows **strong regional variation**, with southern states consistently scoring lower.
- Hospitals with lower scores on **nurse and doctor communication** had disproportionately low overall ratings.
- Measures like **hospital quietness and pain management** were frequently flagged for improvement.

## 💼 Real-World Application

This project simulates core responsibilities of a **Market Research Analyst** at companies like **IQVIA**, including:
- Designing survey-based analyses
- Working with healthcare-specific data
- Performing segmentation and dashboarding
- Generating client-ready insights
